# Conversion Input Program
This Java program performs unit conversions based on user input. The conversions supported are:

    Feet to Meters
    Pounds to Kilograms
    Fahrenheit to Celsius
## How It Works
  The program uses a Scanner to read input from the user.
  It prompts the user to enter the unit they want to convert from and the unit they want to convert to.
  The user also inputs the quantity to be converted.
  The program then performs the appropriate conversion using one of the three methods:
    FeetToMeters
    PoundsToKgs
    FahrenheitToCelsius
The result of the conversion is displayed.
The user is asked if they want to restart the program or exit.
# Conversion Methods
Feet to Meters: The method FeetToMeters multiplies the quantity by 0.305.
Pounds to Kilograms: The method PoundsToKgs multiplies the quantity by 0.454.
Fahrenheit to Celsius: The method FahrenheitToCelsius uses the formula (Quantity - 32) * (5/9).
# Program Loop
The program runs in a loop, repeatedly asking for input and performing conversions until the user chooses to exit by entering 'N' when prompted to restart the program.
# How to Run
    Copy the code into a file named ConvertionInput.java.
    Compile the program using javac ConvertionInput.java.
    Run the program using java ConvertionInput.
    Follow the prompts to perform conversions.
# Note
## The conversion formulas used are:

    Feet to Meters: Quantity * 0.305
    Pounds to Kilograms: Quantity * 0.454
    Fahrenheit to Celsius: (Quantity - 32) * (5.0 / 9.0)
